# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

PS5 instock locator 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

For my project I want to create a program then sends me text alerts when the new PLaystation 5 is in stock.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My software will hold links to various website links to Playstation 5's and will respond to tell me if the Playstation is in stock or not.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome of my project is for my program to work and be useful to myself.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome of my final project would be for it to be useful and help me buy a Playstation 5

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best outcome for my project is for my project to be in the top 3 projects of the class!

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

In the next steps of my project I need to figure out exaclty how to accomplish my idea. I need to set and outline for myself and for completing the project. I will need to figure out how to set up the code to send me text alerts more importantly because I believe that will be the hardest part of my project.
